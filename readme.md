# Pre-amble

Hi

I am really enjoying poe2 and after 150 hours I wanted to take a break but can't stop thinking about the game.

I also really need to brush up on my programming skills after not touching anything for nearly a year after my bootcamp (Barring what I've done for uni & working).

I've been focusing really hard on trying to do well in my new position I accepted right after the bootcamp, but now it's time to be ready to transisition into a new role. (Hopefully in the CS space)

Anyways onto the project.

# Problem Statement

While I was enjoying the game, there is something that I feel is missing, a lot of people in my sphere were actively checking in on the currency exchange in game, because they wanted to see where to invest early to make some big money (In-game).

Now I want to create a simple site that has all the conversion ratios easy to acess on a simple site, not overly complex to get started with.

Maybe add a discord bot integration?? Could be fun

## Issue with site

GGG has not provided an open API as of yet for poe2 however nothing says I can't be ready for when this is made available!

### Stack

MERN for the site
